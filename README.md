## What is Fleshroot Protocol?
Fleshroot Protocol is a dark, arcane twist on the classic material farming modpack. Gone are the polished metals and cold machines—this world runs on organic bio-structures, pulsing with flesh, bone, bile, and blood. Alchemy replaces engineering. Sacrifice replaces automation.

Sacrificial Magic – Channel arcane power through rituals and offerings.

Magical Biomes – Explore new surreal environments teeming with mystical resources.

Hidden Depths – Discover buried, grotesque ecosystems and forbidden chambers.
